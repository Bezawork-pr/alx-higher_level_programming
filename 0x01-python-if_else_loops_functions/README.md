# <pre> Python - if/else, loops, functions </pre>
This project focuses on mastering the importance of indentation and how to use the if and if ... else statements. It provides practice cases to master the while and for loops, the break and continues statements, and pass statement. range and diving into functions in Python are also part of this project. It also focuses on understanding scope of variables, understanding traceback, and how to use arithmetic operators.

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
* [0-positive_or_negative.py]( https://github.com/Bezawork-pr/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/0-positive_or_negative.py): Python script that assigns random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. It prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative or zero.
* The output of the program is:
    * The number, followed by
        * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        * if the number is 0: `is zero`
        * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * followed by a new line

### 1. The last digit
* [1-last_digit.py](https://github.com/Bezawork-pr/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/1-last_digit.py): Python script that assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. It also  print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
* The output of the program is:
   * the string `Last digit of is`, followed by the `last digit of number`, followed by
      * if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and `is greater than 5`
      * if the last digit is 0: the string and `is 0`
      * if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and `is less than 6 and not 0`
   * followed by a new line
* [Source-code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py)
